==Description==

Flexible Bootstrap v.3 theme allowing various column configurations and customizable colours and title widgets.

==More feature==

ToeBox is the other end of the boot.  It's intention is to give you all the flexibility of Bootstrap without making you install Node, Grunt, Ruby or any other extras.
Because it is based on Bootstrap you are able to use all its elements and styles.  It is compatible with any Bootstrap related plug-ins like the ToeBox plug-in which offers a Carousel post type among other Bootstrap compatible featuers.
Install WP-Less and you will be able to create completely custom colour schemes right from WordPress.
