A WordPress theme using a minimalist approach and Bootstrap.

We started with Bootstrap, extracted colors to it's own file with light and dark varient files.  We added less support va WP-Less and less.php.  Then we added a minimal theme framework and templates.  Now there are customization options for header and header image and background colors. Look for more dynamic themes via less soon.
