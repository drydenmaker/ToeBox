# Contributing to Bootstrap

Looking to contribute something to Bootstrap ToeBox? **Here's how you can help.**

Please take a moment to review this document in order to make the contribution
process easy and effective for everyone involved.

Following these guidelines helps to communicate that you respect the time of
the developers managing and developing this open source project. In return,
they should reciprocate that respect in addressing your issue or assessing
patches and features.


## Using the issue tracker

The [issue tracker](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/issues) is
the preferred channel for [bug reports](#bug-reports), [features requests](#feature-requests)
and [submitting pull requests](#pull-requests), but please respect the following
restrictions:

* Please **do not** use the issue tracker for personal support requests.  Stack
  Overflow ([`twitter-bootstrap-3`](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/twitter-bootstrap-3) tag) or [IRC](README.md#community) are better places to get help.

* Please **do not** derail or troll issues. Keep the discussion on topic and
  respect the opinions of others.

* Please **do not** open issues or pull requests regarding the code in bootstrap itself (the project from which this was forked).  See the [Bootstrap project](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap).


We are just starting out so any feedback is
